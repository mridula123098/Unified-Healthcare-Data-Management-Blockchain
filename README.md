A blockchain-based patient-centric healthcare data management system using Hyperledger Fabric, IPFS, Smart Contracts, and Decentralized Identity.
Unified Healthcare Data Management: A Blockchain-Based Patient-Centric System

This repository contains the research work and architecture for a blockchain-powered healthcare data management system that ensures secure, interoperable, and patient-controlled medical information exchange.

# About the Project

This paper proposes a decentralized healthcare data management framework that uses:
Hyperledger Fabric (permissioned blockchain)
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) (off-chain storage)
Smart Contracts (Chaincode)
Decentralized Identity (DID)
AES Encryption
The system gives full data ownership to patients while creating a transparent, tamper-proof medical record management system.

# Key Features

Patient-controlled health record sharing
Smart contract–based permission management
Secure off-chain storage with on-chain hashes
Immutable access logs
DID-based identity authentication
HIPAA-compliant architecture
Scalable hybrid storage model
